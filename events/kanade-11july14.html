<h1>Current trends in programming languages and research</h1>
<b>Speaker:</b> Prof. Aditya Kanade, CSA, IISc<br>
<b>Date:</b> July 11, 2014
<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>
This is an exciting time for research in programming languages. Many
recent innovations ranging from smart devices and cloud/web to online
education and end-user programming are throwing up foundational
challenges for programming languages technologies. In this talk, I
will review these recent innovations and identify the central role of
programming languages in supporting them. I will pose some of the
foundational research problems in this setting. The talk will then
discuss a couple of our recent contributions in this space: (1) formal
analysis of concurrent Android applications [PLDI'14] and (2)
automated program repair [ICSE'14].
