<h1>Energy Aware Software Systems</h1>
<b>Speaker:</b> Prof. Y. N. Srikant, CSA, IISc<br>
<b>Date:</b> August 13, 2014
<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>
The importance of saving energy in general need not be over-emphasized.
Computing equipment of various kinds, e.g., mobile phones, laptops, portable
games, desktops, servers, and large data centres, all deserve to be considered
seriously as candidates for saving energy. An important addition to this list
is the software that runs on these platforms.

This talk will provide an overview of various techniques for saving energy
in a computer system, both by hardware and software means.
