		<h2>(Software) Engineering for Social Impact</h2>

	<h3>Anandwan Project</h3>
	<p align='justify'>
	In this project we are collaborating with 
	<a href="http://www.anandwan.in/">Anandawan</a>, a village near
	Warora, Maharashtra, which has about 2500 residents, most of whom are
	afflicted with leprosy, blindness, muteness or some other disability.
	The village is a landmark in a variety of aspects, like economic
	self-sufficiency, environmental sustainability etc.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	In many of the issues faced by people in Anandwan and the various
	plans they have, advanced technology plays a central role.
	Accessible computing (for the physically disabled), IT-enabled
	health information system,
	technology-driven agriculture being some of them. We are 
	collaborating with Anandwan to provide technological inputs to 
	the solution to these problems.
