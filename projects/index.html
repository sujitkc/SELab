<h1>Symbolic Testing of Embedded Software Systems</h1>
<p>
Model-driven engineering (MDE) is a promising new paradigm in system
development. Its potential stems from its emphasis on using high-level 
modelling languages for specifying, designing and developing systems, while 
automating many of the downstreams activities like programming, simulation
and testing. A large family of commercial softwares are available which 
support this paradigm. This has led to a wide-spread adoption of model-based
approach in the Industry, particularly in the safety-critical embedded 
domain. For example, Matlab Simulink is now a <i>de facto</i> standard development
platform in the automotive and aerospace domain.
</p>
<p>
<i>Symbolic testing</i> has proved to be a very 
successful testing methology in program testing. There are a number of 
characteristics in such models which add new challenges to applying 
symbolic testing and as also provide opportunities to simplify the
process.
</p>
<p>
In this project, we apply symbolic testing to test models designed
with Matlab Simulink and similar languages.

<h1>Verification of Refinements of Embedded Software Architecture</h1>
<p>
Embedded software architectures typically describe the physical components
of the embedded system along with the software components and are extensively
being used to describe the architecture of software residing in automotive,
avionics and other embedded applications. Such architectures are defined
in a modular fashion like all others, with detailed architectural constructs
evolving with successive refinements. We are exploring the problem of formally
modeling and verifying embedded software architectures with the aim of 
proving a refined architecture to be correct with respect to its abstract
architecture, in terms of satisfying a set of specified properties. This
project is currently using AADL as a benchmark language for embedded 
software architecture. EventB is used to formally represent such architectures
and refinements are being shown to be correct with respect to their 
semantics as represented by EventB. 
</p>

<h1>Specification, Verification and Validation of Web-Applications</h1>
<p>
Representational State Transfer (REST) is the latest architectural style 
catching a lot of attention in the domain of web-service design and 
implementation. Web-services, due to their distributed, loosely-coupled,
and syndicated architecture, provide very unique challenges to software
engineers at every stage of SDLC, beginning with specification all the
way upto testing.
</p>
<p>
In this project, we are dealing with the challenges of formal specification
and automated testing of web-services, specifically RESTful web-services
-- the web-services following the REST architecture.</p>
