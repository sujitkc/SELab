		<h2>Program analysis, test case generation and motion planning for robotics software </h2>
		<p>
		Industrial robots that are deployed in the domains of manufacturing,
		food processing, packaging etc., typically perform tasks like welding,
		pick and place, painting, assembly, material handling etc. Such robots
		are programmed to carry out these tasks using proprietory programming
		languages. We work with one such language, Rapid, an ABB language for
		programming industrial robots. Rapid has complex data types to specify
		co-ordinate systems for the robots and the regions of their operation,
		motion primitives to specify end effector movement and programming
		language control statements including branching, looping, procedure
		calls, interrupts etc. to program the robots.
		</p>
		<p>
		We have developed a comprehensive program analysis framework to detect
		low level errors in Rapid programs. Our framework can handle complex
		data types, robot motion primitives, timer resets and
		interrupts. Properties that can be automatically checked are out of
		bounds array access, infinite loops, division by zero, detecting
		unused variables and code, robot boundary violations etc.
		</p>
		<p>
		We are also working on test case generation algorithms for Rapid that
		can do white-box test case generation including branch and loop
		coverage. Test cases for regression testing basd on decision trees are
		also being worked on.
		</p>
		<p>
		In collaboration with IIT-Kanpur, we are working motion planning
		algorithms, that given a set of high level tasks, working arena and
		obstacles can generate a sequence of collision-free robot
		configurations achieving the specified goal.
