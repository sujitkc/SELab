		<h2>Formal verification of Simulink models</h2>
		<p>
		Simulink is an industry-standard for design of embedded control
		software. We are working on problems involving formal verifying
		Simulink models along three directions:
		<ol type="a">
		<li>
			Deductive verification of Simulink models: Controllers modelled
			using Simulink are verified to meet their requirements (specifically
			steady state requirements) using deductive verification. This approach
			considers an approximate semantics of the continuous plant behavior,
			models the controller algorithm and verifies the combined
			controller+plant model for meeting the requirements.
		</li>
		<li>
			Controller engineers develop Simulink models of the controlled
			system and plant in an iterative fashion starting with an abstract
			model and applying several rounds of refinement to arrive at the final
			controller. The model is validated at each step by extensive
			simulations. We have developed an assume-guarantee framework that
			supports iterative development of controllers in Simulink. Initially,
			in the abstract model, several desired properties of the controller
			are not designed. As and when the designer adds parts of the
			controller model, Simulink's internal verifier, SLDV is used to
			prove the requirements that are assumed as guarantees of the model at
			that stage. Our work has been tested on two real-life case studies
			involving SLDV.
		</li>
		<li> 
			Design engineers used Simulink's operational semantics to run
			simulations that validate the controller to meet various
			specifications. The operational semantics provides numerically
			approximate solutions to the continuous dynamics of the plant through
			a library of discrete and continuous solvers. We are capturing the
			semantics of these solvers using the Isabelle theorem prover. We
			believe that the controller requirements with the numerical
			approximation can be proved to be correct using Isabelle theorem
			prover.
