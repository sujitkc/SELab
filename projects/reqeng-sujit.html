		<h2>Formal Specificationf of Web apps using Statecharts</h2>

	Statechart is an industry standard notation for describing 
	life-cycles of important objects in a system. It is widely used in a
	variety of domains ranging from embedded to web-based enterprise 
	software systems. A Statechart model is often large enough software 
	artifact that it should come under the regular processes of quality 
	assurance. Formal methods are mathematical techniques typically 
	applied to verification and validation of systems. Formal methods 
	have enjoyed signficant success and acceptance in the VLSI industry.
	In software, application domains bracketed as <i>safety critical</i>
	have embraced formal methods in their regular QA process in many 
	cases. However, penetration of formal methods in other domains has
	been limited. The widely held perception that formal methods is 
	hard to do plays an important role in this.
	</p>
	<p align='justify'>   
	In this work, we intend to develop formal methods for general 
	application domains. We have decided to use Statechart as the 
	central element, which is a familiar notation to many software 
	engineers. The technical work envisaged herein involves development
	of Statechart as a formal specification language, and development 
	of algorithms to verify and validate the system both via static 
	verification and automated testing. Formalisation of a well-known 
	notation like Statechart will help wider acceptance in two ways. 
	Firstly, it will help use of formal methods in a wider range of 
	application domains. Secondly, it will make it accessible to a 
	wider population of software engineers.
